I can confirm a similar issue with my touchpad on HP ProBook 450 G6 with Ubuntu 18.04, it was very laggy after suspend.

What worked for me: create /lib/systemd/system-sleep/touchpad:

#!/bin/sh

case $1 in
  post)
    /sbin/rmmod i2c_hid && /sbin/modprobe i2c_hid 
  ;;
esac

make file executable chmod +x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/touchpad and test (suspend computer and wake-up again)
